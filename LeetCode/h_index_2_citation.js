// Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
//
// According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
//
// Example:
//
//     Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had
// received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
//     Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining
// two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
// Note:
//
//     If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

/**
 * @param {number[]} citations
 * @return {number}
